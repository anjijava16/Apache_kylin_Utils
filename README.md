# What is Apache Kylin?

Apache Kylin is a distributed open source online analytics processing (OLAP) engine for interactive analytics Big Data. Apache Kylin has been designed to provide SQL interface and multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP) on Hadoop/Spark. In addition, it easily integrates with BI tools via ODBC driver, JDBC driver, and REST API. It was created by eBay in 2014, graduated to Top Level Project of Apache Software Foundation just one year later, in 2015 and won the Best Open Source Big Data Tool in 2015 as well as in 2016. Currently, it is being used by thousands of companies worldwide as their critical analytics application for Big Data. While other OLAP engines struggle with the data volume, Kylin enables query responses in the milliseconds. It provides sub-second level query latency over datasets scaling to petabytes. It gets its amazing speed by precomputing the various dimensional combinations and the measure aggregates via Hive queries and populating HBase with the results.

Apache Kylin™ is an open source, distributed Analytical Data Warehouse for Big Data; it was designed to provide OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) capability in the big data era. By renovating the multi-dimensional cube and precalculation technology on Hadoop and Spark, Kylin is able to achieve near constant query speed regardless of the ever-growing data volume. Reducing query latency from minutes to sub-second, Kylin brings online analytics back to big data.

Apache Kylin™ lets you query billions of rows at sub-second latency in 3 steps.

1. Identify a Star/Snowflake Schema on Hadoop.
2. Build Cube from the identified tables.
3. Query using ANSI-SQL and get results in sub-second, via ODBC, JDBC or RESTful API.
